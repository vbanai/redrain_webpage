    "/static",
    StaticFiles(directory=BASE_DIR / "static"),
    name="static",
)

# {{ url_for("static", filename="style.css") }}
# Means:

# Ask the FastAPI app:
# do you have a route named static?  “Static” means: Files that are sent as-is, without Python logic: css, js, images, fonts   route statc mean holding static files “For every HTTP request whose path starts with /static, serve files from the filesystem folder BASE_DIR/static.”
# If yes, build the correct URL.”
# /static becomes an endpoint, but not like  routes in routes.py.
# It is a mounted ASGI app, not a normal route function.
# endpoints in FastAPI:
# Type A — Function-based routes (what is in routes.py), they are registered in the router
# Type B — Mounted applications (what /static is) This does not create a function, 
# but hands the request over to another ASGI app.
# A request is simply: One message sent by the browser to my server asking for something.
# if I type for example: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ browser sends ONE HTTP request: GET /  Host: 127.0.0.1:8000 this goes to Uvicorn listening on 127.0.0.1:8000   
# when fastapi receives: GET /  it does: check mounted apps: fastapi_app.mount("/static", ...) Does "/" start with "/static"? no , so skip then check routes @router.get("/")  match found

#  REQUEST HANDLING IN DETAIL

# first what is  request:  
# it’s not the raw network request, It’s an object with all headers, URL, query parameters, cookies, plus a reference to the app (request.app).
# That’s why we can do: request.app.state.redis_client
# uvicorn receives it and calls the top ASGI app (Engine.IO wrapper).
# The Engine.IO wrapper decides:
# Is this a Socket.IO handshake? → handle it here
# Is it a normal HTTP request? → forward to other_asgi_app (your FastAPI app)
# If it’s forwarded, then request in FastAPI is a Python object representing that HTTP request.
# ASGI: the standard “language” ,"protocol" that async Python async web servers speak
# UVICORN listens on HTTP, converts the request into an ASGI “event”, and calls your FastAPI app.
# if I write @app.get("/") async def home() fastapi turns this into sg ASGI understand  so uvicorn can call it
# Engine.IO is Low-level WebSocket + long-polling protocol, Used by Socket.IO, which is a higher-level library for realtime events.
# Middleware: sits between the server and your endpoint. pl session middleware It checks for a session cookie, and makes request.session available. vagy CORS middleware → allows cross-domain requests vagy Authentication middleware → checks if a user is logged in
# Templates:  HTML files with placeholders (variables or code) that are filled dynamically. Jinja2 is the template engine FastAPI uses by default. <h1>Hello {{ user_name }}</h1>

# FASTAPI 1.) checks mounted apps (StaticFiles(...)) but skip start handling
#         2.) checks routes: @router.get("/") async def index(...) Match found index() is called 
#          3.) response is sent  : index.html is turned into HTML text, and send it to the browser 
#         4.) browser parses (reads and understanding and discovering the HTML) the HTML <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css"> etc.
#         5.) for every URL it finds the browser sends a new request   
#            /static/style.css   ->   GET /static/style.css   
#           /static/logo.png -> GET /static/logo.png
#           /login (only if clicked) ->  GET /login
#           /static/style.css is automatic CSS is required to render the page This again goes to Uvicorn → FastAPI
#          6.) FastAPI again checks in order: Step 1 — Mounted apps   
#               Does /static/style.css start with /static?   YES    Forward request to StaticFiles

# Include your routes AFTER mounting static
from mywebpage.routes import router

# here we Attach the router box defined on routes.py to the app
fastapi_app.include_router(router)
